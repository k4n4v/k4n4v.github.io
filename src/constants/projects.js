        description: "Lead developer in a team of 4 to design, engineer, and prototype an optometrist device for early Alzheimer‚Äôs detection. Utilized a webcam for eye tracking, employed Python with OpenCV to determine the pupil‚Äôs location, and used MATLAB for plotting and analyzing over 700 data points collected per trial. Presented the device at a trade show, earning 2nd place with positive feedback and interest from industry professionals.",
