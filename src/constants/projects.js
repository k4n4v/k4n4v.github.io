        description: "In this project I was the dead developer in a team of 4 to design, engineer, and prototype an optometrist device for early Alzheimer‚Äôs detection. We utilized a webcam for eye tracking, employed Python with OpenCV to determine the pupil‚Äôs location, and used MATLAB for plotting and analyzing over 700 data points collected per trial. The device was also presented at my university's engineering capstone trade show, earning 2nd place with positive feedback and interest from industry professionals.",

        description: "This project is an AI-powered web scraper built using Python that runs locally on your machine. The application takes a URL as input, scrapes the website's DOM content, and uses a local large language model (LLM) to extract specific information based on a prompt provided by the user. By running the LLM locally, you can avoid the need to purchase tokens from external services. The project handles large amounts of data by breaking it into manageable batches to avoid character limits, ensuring efficient and effective data processing. The technical implementation utilizes tools such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup, LangChain, and more.",
